# Tabling

- ‼️‼️SCORE BALANCING‼️‼️
- Making letter dealing satisfying
- More continuous animation for letter fade-in -> no actual circle rotation
- Checking and ending game if no more playable words exist

# Design Choices To Evaluate

- Assumes maximum overlap possible (even if that does not allow the word to be played because the word fully overlaps)
- Timer counting up or down 🤔
